# Valtech-Dashboard
As a final project of SIT Learning, Valtech Switzerland has commissioned my team, a proof of concept for project managers that they can see all their consultants' competencies and availabilities to assign them to the appropriate project. Currently Valtech has two separate systems for booking consultants. My team created a system using a shared timeframe that simultaneously assignes to project's date range and assigned consultant's availability. The timeframe adjusts by dynamic changes in deadlines as well.

## Tools
React, Redux, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, DigitalOcean, NGINX, Gunicorn, Postgres, Agile, Scrum

## Demos
